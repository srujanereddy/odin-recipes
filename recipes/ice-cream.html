        <p>This chocolate ice cream is a rich, custard-style ice cream flavored with semisweet chocolate and cocoa powder.</p>
        <p>Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked items such as Baked Alaska.</p>
