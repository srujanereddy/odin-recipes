        <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
        <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular. Similar dishes are also prepared in Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>
        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>
            <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>
            <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>
            <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
